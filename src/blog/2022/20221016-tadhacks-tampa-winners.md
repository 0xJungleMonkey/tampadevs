This weekend was AMAZING!!!!

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO MADE IT OUT TO TADHACKS!!!

We know for some of you this was your very first hackathon, and for others you drove all the way from University of Central Florida in Orlando to compete too. For others with more experience, it was really endearing to see all the mentorship go around. Some of you guys pulled all nighters too after we closed up shop at 8 pm, and others just pulled in last minute clutch for presentation time for Sunday. We had 12 different teams in total compete!!!

We had so many awesome and crazy ideas presented here! From an application where you have to scream at a mic to tell a car not to crash (Elon musk would be proud), to an app solving a problem in finding a hackathon team. And projects with Raspberry PI clusters to solve issues in our most recent hurricane episode too! To an application that actually solves problems that we ourselves as organizers need (finding sponsors) too!

Shoutout to all the teams who participated:

- Hackateams
- H.O.P.E
