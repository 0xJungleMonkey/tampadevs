We have a new merch store!!!

We decided to setup our first [Shopify](https://shopify.com) web store and it's been phenomenal! Within just a few hours we setup a fully functional webstore that looks great on mobile and desktop

Feel free to check it out live here! At [store.tampa.dev](https://store.tampa.dev)

Support Tampa Devs by buying T-Shirts, Bandanas, Hats and more! We're always coming up with new awesome swag ideas too!

You can pickup the swag at one of our events for free, or pay a shipping/handling fee to have it shipped to you
