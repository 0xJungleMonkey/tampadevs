Hey y'all, we're partnering with USF engineering for planning [TADHacks Hackathon](https://tadhack.com/2022) in October! Event link is found [here](https://www.meetup.com/tampadevs/events/284553267/)

Ali is our new department chair for coordinating these efforts with the different [computer science clubs and programs](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/undergraduate/student-organizations.aspx) at USF.

We're also coordinating efforts with Embarc Collective to bring the startup scene to the hackathon as well. We have a number of sponsors handling food, swag, and prizes in the pipeline as well

More updates to come in the future! Hit us up on the tampa devs slack if you have an interest in help planning
