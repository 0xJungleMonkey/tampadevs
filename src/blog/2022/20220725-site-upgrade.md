We just had a huge upgrade to the site!

We went from a roughly 50 lighthouse score to 97 now! The site should run blazing fast for any new users, regardless of caching

Here's the improvements to the site:

- Compressed MP4 several times so it's down to a 1.4 mB load from a 4mB load. iOS users should be able to play the site on lowPower mode as well
- Compressed all images to less than 1000width and webp on initial page load. We removed roughly 4mbs of pageload times
- Added additional animation support for call to action, made it more obvious to see where meetup/slack link buttons are
- Added whatsapp chat link
