## Details

We're hosting our another software tech talk at ReliaQuest, this time at their west tampa location! You can watch it remotely through zoom - we'll post a link in the comments around that time

ALSO, if you do attend, there will be Fresh Kitchen for catering too!


## Talk1 - Let's Build a Reliable Webhook Event Processor

You may have heard of Webhooks before, but have you ever built a system that can process Webhook Events reliably and at scale?Buckle up, because in this session, Chris will break down webhook fundamentals, best practices, and top it off by building a webhook processor from scratch in TypeScript!

His programming language of choice is TypeScript, but has experience in C#, Rust, and Go.

Professionally, Chris is the CTO of a local technology company called "Relativity", where he and his talented engineering team build automation-enabled software products.

## Talk2 - Serverless Functions

Jackson will be a talk on serverless functions! And the differnet tools in the AWS environment to set this up!

## PARKING LOGISTICS:

Just an FYI, this is the address for the other ReliaQuest office near the international mall, not the one on harbour island

There is a large parking garage attached to this building, attendees can park anywhere in the garage and this does not require any parking validation.

Our office is on the third floor, so just take the elevators up! The doors downstairs may lock, so we will have someone downstairs to monitor and let everyone in.

Suite 300
